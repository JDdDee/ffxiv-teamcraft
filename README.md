## Support the Developer

Teamcraft is a website and tool built for the community and any support is appreciated. As little as [$1 a month](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=702160) has a significant impact on Teamcraft's development and brings me closer to my dream of becoming a full-time developer on this project and expanding it beyond just being a tool for FFXIV.
